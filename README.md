The SeaPort Program will simulate some of the aspects of a number of Sea Ports. The project will be put together via four individual projects. A summary is below.
Read a data file, create the internal data structure, create a GUI to display the structure, and let the user search the structure.
Sort the structure, use hash maps to create the structure more efficiently.
Create a thread for each job, cannot run until a ship has a dock, create a GUI to show the progress of each job.
Simulate competing for resources (persons with particular skills) for each job.
